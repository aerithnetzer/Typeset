# Typeset

Typeset aims to be the final unification of plain-text, single-source publishing. Using pandoc as a base, from a single markdown file, use CI/CD tools to build out PDF, Web, JATS, and other versions of an article.

Who needs overly burdensome journal managements systems when you have pandoc and hugo?
