== Background and Motivation
<background-and-motivation>
Northwestern University Libraries publishes two peer-reviewed journals,
The Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies, and Studies in Russian
Philosophy, Literature, and Religious Thought. Northwestern’s journal
publishing operates under tight economic constraints—direct and
opportunity—and therefore must solve the same problems of corporate
academic publishers with a fraction of the resources available

#footnote[RELX. 2023. "Market Segments." RELX.]. One of these problems
is reference metadata, i.e., machine-actionable references that are then
used to count citations of articles. The act of capturing, counting, and
using citations accurately enables funding agencies, universities, and
publishers to make data-driven decisions for funding allocation,
reviewers to validate the research of a manuscript, and faster
literature review.
