<abstract>
<p>Northwestern University spent far too much time and effort curating
citation data by hand. Here, we show that large language models can be
an efficient way to convert plain-text citations to BibTeX for use in
machine-actionable metadata. Further, we prove that these models can be
run locally, without cloud compute cost. With these tools,
university-owned publishing operations can increase their operating
efficiency which, when combined with human review, has no effect on
quality.</p>

  <title>Background and Motivation</title>
  <p>Northwestern University Libraries publishes two peer-reviewed
  journals, The Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies, and Studies in
  Russian Philosophy, Literature, and Religious Thought. Northwestern’s
  journal publishing operates under tight economic constraints—direct
  and opportunity—and therefore must solve the same problems of
  corporate academic publishers with a fraction of the resources
  available <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref>. One of these problems is
  reference metadata, i.e., machine-actionable references that are then
  used to count citations of articles. The act of capturing, counting,
  and using citations accurately enables funding agencies, universities,
  and publishers to make data-driven decisions for funding allocation,
  reviewers to validate the research of a manuscript, and faster
  literature review.</p>
